GUI changes
-----------

- Added new console commands to the `Debug window -> Console` for improved privacy:

    - `clear` -- clears the console output area
    - `clear-all` -- clears both output and command history.
    - `history` -- lists stored command history.
    - `history-clear` -- clears command history only.

  These additions improve privacy and convenience in shared or long-lived
  sessions by allowing users to remove sensitive commands and output from view.
